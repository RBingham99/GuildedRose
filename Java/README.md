# Gilded Rose starting position in Java

To try this project simply clone the directory to your device, open the project, navigate to the App.java class and
click the run button on the main method.

This is my guilded rose project, the point of this project is to refactor the bad code it originally had.

To do this I started by writing tests to make sure anything I changed didn't break the code,
I then ran the tests after every small change I made.
